All website design was created by following a [Figma design template](https://www.figma.com/file/06PtNrPYuEW8IelmJG6gI7/payapi-multi-page-website?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev).

This website contains four pages: Home, Pricing, About and Contact.
- The Home page contains information on the company and their product.
- The Pricing page contains information on pricing, separated in three columns.
- The About page contains more detailed information on the company.
- The Contact page contains a contact form with functional validation.

The website is responsive, and changes and moves elements accordingly depending on device screen size.

Each page contains functional hover effects, a "Ready to start?" section with an email input field with functional validation, a footer and a functional navigation bar which changes to a hamburger menu when browsing on mobile screens.
